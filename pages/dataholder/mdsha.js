                        <p>Hurricane Florence Case Study - In light of the significant damage in the state of North Carolina caused by the storm surge from Hurricane Florence on September 14, 2018, concerns about the vulnerability of the coastal communities on the Atlantic coast of Maryland and in Marylandâ€™s portion of the Chesapeake Bay have come into focus. This project seeks to replicate the storm surge heights seen with Hurricane Florence, to determine a what-if scenario in coastal Maryland.</p>
