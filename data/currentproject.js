          description: "The ESRGC is currently working with Maryland’s Department of Information Technology (DoIT) to provide public access to bare earth LiDAR throughout the state. Raw LiDAR data is processed by the ESRGC and image services are published through ArcGIS for Server. There are six derivative products on our topography server which are all accessible through WMS connection, Google Earth, and ArcGIS software. These derivative products include aspect, hillshade, slope, shaded relief and DEMs in meters and feet. In addition to the server, we are also maintaining a topography viewer web application that allows users to interact directly with the LiDAR data hosted on our servers. \n\n As a GIS service provider and advocate for collaborative GIS solutions in Maryland, the Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative is committed to contributing to the shared GIS data resources found on MD iMap.",

          description: "The ESRGC is currently working with Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources, the Critical Area Commission, and County representatives in the statewide updating of Maryland’s Critical Area Boundary. Analysts are using high resolution true-color orthophotography, color infrared imagery, and ortho-rectified tidal wetlands maps to determine the edge of shoreline and the landward edge of tidal wetlands which will then be used to create the 1000 foot Critical Area boundary.",

          description: "To better inform Maryland's state delegates and senators about the land use issues in their district as well as to provide them with a useful reference map to use during discussions with constituents, the ESRGC has completed a project to create a large format map of land use for each 2012 state legislative district in Maryland. These maps were given as gifts to the senators and delegates in February 2012, with the compliments of Salisbury University, the MidShore Regional Council, and the Tri-County Council of the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland.",

          description: "FirstNet is a national project which aims to provide emergency responders with the first nationwide, high-speed, wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety. Commercial broadband networks were not designed to support public safety needs and are unreliable in emergency events. Emergency responders are unable to communicate when too many users access a commercial network at the same time and crash the network during an emergency event, such as a natural disaster. FirstNet will allow first responders and other public safety units to communicate during an emergency event using a network devoted entirely to public safety. The ESRGC provides Maryland’s FirstNet team with comprehensive mapping support, experience in mapping broadband assets and wireless coverage in Maryland, and website development.",
