          "description": "The Mid-Atlantic region is predicted to have some of the worst impacts of Sea Level Change because of the combination of rise, subsidence, and relative position to the North Atlantic Gyre. With 3,190 miles of coast, Maryland State Highway Administration is prioritizing and mitigating the potential impact of baseline SLC on SHA assets, as well as the increased impact of coastal flooding that will result. Using USACE SLC projections, USGS studies, and NOAA tidal observations, the ESRGC provides SHA forecast intelligence on 2015, 2050, and 2100 scenarios, helping protect Maryland’s long-term investments.",

          description: "The ESRGC is currently working with Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources, the Critical Area Commission, and County representatives in the statewide updating of Maryland’s Critical Area Boundary. Analysts are using high resolution true-color orthophotography, color infrared imagery, and ortho-rectified tidal wetlands maps to determine the edge of shoreline and the landward edge of tidal wetlands which will then be used to create the 1000 foot Critical Area boundary.",

          description: "To better inform Maryland's state delegates and senators about the land use issues in their district as well as to provide them with a useful reference map to use during discussions with constituents, the ESRGC has completed a project to create a large format map of land use for each 2012 state legislative district in Maryland. These maps were given as gifts to the senators and delegates in February 2012, with the compliments of Salisbury University, the MidShore Regional Council, and the Tri-County Council of the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland.",

          description: "FirstNet is a national project which aims to provide emergency responders with the first nationwide, high-speed, wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety. Commercial broadband networks were not designed to support public safety needs and are unreliable in emergency events. Emergency responders are unable to communicate when too many users access a commercial network at the same time and crash the network during an emergency event, such as a natural disaster. FirstNet will allow first responders and other public safety units to communicate during an emergency event using a network devoted entirely to public safety. The ESRGC provides Maryland’s FirstNet team with comprehensive mapping support, experience in mapping broadband assets and wireless coverage in Maryland, and website development.",
