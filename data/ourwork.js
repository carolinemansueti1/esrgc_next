Using USACE SLC projections, USGS studies, and NOAA tidal observations, the ESRGC provides SHA forecast intelligence on 2015, 2050, and 2100 scenarios, helping protect Maryland’s long-term investments.

Commercial broadband networks were not designed to support public safety needs and are unreliable in emergency events. Emergency responders are unable to communicate when too many users access a commercial network at the same time and crash the network during an emergency event, such as a natural disaster. FirstNet will allow first responders and other public safety units to communicate during an emergency event using a network devoted entirely to public safety. The ESRGC provides Maryland’s FirstNet team with comprehensive mapping support, experience in mapping broadband assets and wireless coverage in Maryland, and website development. ",

Salisbury University School of Nursing (SUSON), in collaboration with University of Maryland School of Nursing (UMSON), is committed to developing this free web resource to help address the nursing shortage.
