          description: "The Mid-Atlantic region is predicted to have some of the worst impacts of Sea Level Change because of the combination of rise, subsidence, and relative position to the North Atlantic Gyre. With 3,190 miles of coast, Maryland State Highway Administration is prioritizing and mitigating the potential impact of baseline SLC on SHA assets, as well as the increased impact of coastal flooding that will result. Using USACE SLC projections, USGS studies, and NOAA tidal observations, the ESRGC provides SHA forecast intelligence on 2015, 2050, and 2100 scenarios, helping protect Maryland’s long-term investments."
